Overview of the Project
Project Title: Predicting Housing Prices Using Linear Regression

Objective: The project aims to predict housing prices based on features from a dataset (USA_Housing.csv). Specifically, the model uses Avg. Area Income as a predictor to estimate Price.

Significance: Understanding the relationship between income and housing prices can help real estate professionals and potential buyers make informed decisions.

Key Activites
1. Problem Identification
Clearly define the problem: predicting housing prices based on one or more features.
Set project objectives, such as understanding the impact of Avg. Area Income on Price and creating a predictive model.

2. Data Collection
Acquire the dataset (USA_Housing.csv) containing relevant features like:
Avg. Area Income
Avg. Area Number of Rooms
Population
Price (target variable)

3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Data Exploration:
Display the first few rows of the dataset using df.head() to understand its structure.
Check for missing values, data types, and outliers.
Preprocessing:
Select relevant features (Avg. Area Income) and target variable (Price).
Normalize or scale the data if required (not necessary for linear regression in this case).

4. Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets using train_test_split:
Training Set: Used to train the model.
Testing Set: Used to evaluate its performance.
Define a test size (e.g., 20% of the dataset) and a random seed for reproducibility.

5. Model Selection
Choose a Simple Linear Regression model from scikit-learn.
Justify the choice: Linear regression is suitable because it assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable (Avg. Area Income) and the dependent variable (Price).

6. Model Training
Fit the model to the training data using the .fit() method.
Learn the relationship between Avg. Area Income and Price.

7. Model Evaluation
Use the testing data to evaluate the model’s performance.
Calculate evaluation metrics like:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences between actual and predicted values.
R-squared (R²): Explains the proportion of variance captured by the model.
Interpret the results to understand the model’s accuracy.

8. Visualization
Regression Line:
Plot the regression line on a scatter plot to compare predicted and actual values visually.
Actual vs. Predicted Plot:
Show how closely the model's predictions match the actual values.
Residuals Plot:
Display the distribution of residuals to verify the assumptions of linear regression (e.g., randomness).

9. Challenges and Limitations
Address issues like:
Potential overfitting or underfitting.
Simplification of the problem by using only one feature (Avg. Area Income).
Highlight opportunities for improvement, such as including more features or exploring non-linear relationships.

10. Results Interpretation
Summarize the key insights:
The strength of the relationship between Avg. Area Income and Price.
The model’s predictive accuracy based on the evaluation metrics.
